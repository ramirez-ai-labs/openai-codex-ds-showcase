## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.8+** installed ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Git** installed (optional, for cloning)
- A **terminal/command prompt** (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Setup Your Environment

### 1.1 Navigate to the Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the repository folder:

```bash
cd openai-codex-ds-showcase
```

### 1.2 Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project's dependencies separate from other Python projects.

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(.venv)` appear at the start of your terminal prompt.

### 1.3 Install Dependencies

Install all the Python packages needed for this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `pandas`: For data analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models
- `streamlit`: For building dashboards
- `plotly`: For interactive charts
- `scipy`: For statistical tests
- `sqlalchemy`: For SQL database connections

**Expected output:** You should see packages being downloaded and installed.

---

## 📊 Step 2: Understand the Repository Structure

Let's see what's in the repository:

```bash
# Windows
dir

# Mac/Linux
ls
```

You should see these main folders:

```
openai-codex-ds-showcase/
├── app.py                          # Main launcher (start here!)
├── README.md                       # Overview of the project
├── GETTING_STARTED.md              # This file
├── METHODOLOGY.md                  # Deep dive into methods
├── requirements.txt                # Python packages needed
│
├── developer-telemetry-simulation/    # Simulates developer data
├── developer-productivity-analysis/   # Analyzes the data
├── code-evaluation-pipeline/          # Tests AI-generated code
└── dashboard/                         # Visual dashboard
```

**What each folder does:**
- **telemetry-simulation**: Creates fake data about developers using AI suggestions
- **productivity-analysis**: Analyzes that data to find patterns
- **code-evaluation-pipeline**: Tests if AI-generated code actually works
- **dashboard**: Shows everything in a visual interface

---

## 🎬 Step 3: Generate Sample Data (Telemetry Simulation)

### What is Telemetry?

**Telemetry** = data collected about how a system is used. In this case, we're tracking:
- When developers see AI suggestions
- Whether they accept or reject them
- How long suggestions take to appear (latency)
- Whether the code compiles and passes tests

### 3.1 Run the Simulation

```bash
python app.py simulate
```

**What happens:**
1. The script creates a CSV file with ~10,000 rows of fake developer data
2. Each row represents one AI suggestion shown to a developer
3. Data includes: acceptance, latency, language, model version, etc.

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Running: python developer-telemetry-simulation/simulate_telemetry.py
✅ Wrote 12345 telemetry rows to telemetry_events.csv
✅ Done.
```

### 3.2 Explore the Generated Data

Let's look at what was created:

```bash
# Windows
type developer-telemetry-simulation\telemetry_events.csv | more

# Mac/Linux
head developer-telemetry-simulation/telemetry_events.csv
```

You'll see columns like:
- `session_id`: Which coding session
- `developer_id`: Which developer
- `accepted`: Did they accept the suggestion? (True/False)
- `latency_ms`: How long did it take? (milliseconds)
- `language`: What programming language?
- `model_version`: Which AI model version? (v1 or v2)

**Key Insight:** This data simulates what we'd collect from real developers using an AI coding assistant.

---

## 📈 Step 4: Basic Data Analysis

### 4.1 Run Acceptance Rate Analysis

```bash
python app.py analyze
```

**What happens:**
1. Loads the telemetry data
2. Calculates overall acceptance rate
3. Compares acceptance by model version (v1 vs v2)
4. Compares acceptance by user segment (beginner/intermediate/expert)
5. Builds a machine learning model to predict acceptance

**Expected output:**
```
=== Overall Acceptance Rate ===
0.512

=== Acceptance Rate by Model Version ===
model_version
model_v1    0.450
model_v2    0.580

=== Classification Report ===
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
...
```

**What this tells us:**
- Overall, ~51% of suggestions are accepted
- Model v2 has higher acceptance (58%) than v1 (45%)
- The model can predict acceptance with reasonable accuracy

### 4.2 Understanding the Results

**Acceptance Rate**: The percentage of AI suggestions that developers actually use. Higher is better!

**Model Comparison**: We're testing if a new model (v2) is better than the old one (v1). It looks like v2 is winning!

---

## 💾 Step 5: SQL Analysis

### What is SQL?

**SQL** = Structured Query Language, used to ask questions of databases. It's like asking: "Show me all suggestions in Python that were accepted."

### 5.1 Run SQL Queries

```bash
python app.py sql
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates a SQLite database from the CSV file
2. Runs 7+ different SQL queries
3. Shows results for each query

**Expected output:**
```
📊 Loading telemetry data...
✅ Created database with 12345 rows

============================================================
Query: Overall Acceptance Rate
============================================================
total_suggestions  accepted_count  acceptance_rate
             12345           6321           0.512
...
```

**Key Queries You'll See:**
1. **Overall metrics**: Total suggestions, acceptance rate
2. **Model comparison**: v1 vs v2 performance
3. **Segmentation**: Acceptance by language, user segment
4. **Session productivity**: How productive are coding sessions?
5. **Error analysis**: What types of errors occur?

**Why SQL matters:** In real companies, data is stored in databases. SQL is how Data Scientists extract insights at scale.

---

## 🔬 Step 6: A/B Testing (Statistical Comparison)

### What is A/B Testing?

**A/B Testing** = Comparing two versions (A and B) to see which is better, using statistics to ensure the difference is real (not just random chance).

### 6.1 Run A/B Test Analysis

```bash
python app.py abtest
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares model v1 vs v2 on multiple metrics
2. Runs statistical tests (chi-square, t-tests)
3. Calculates p-values (probability the difference is real)
4. Provides recommendations

**Expected output:**
```
======================================================================
A/B TEST RESULTS: Model v1 vs Model v2
======================================================================

📊 ACCEPTANCE RATE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Control (v1):     45.0%
Treatment (v2):  58.0%
Difference:      +13.0%
95% CI:          [+10.1%, +15.9%]
P-value:         0.0001
Significant:     ✅ YES
Interpretation:  Treatment higher than control

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATION:
✅ Model v2 shows statistically significant improvement. Recommend rollout.
```

**Understanding the Output:**
- **P-value < 0.05**: The difference is statistically significant (not random)
- **95% CI**: We're 95% confident the true difference is in this range
- **Recommendation**: Based on stats, we should use v2

**Key Insight:** This is how Data Scientists make data-driven decisions about which features to ship!

---

## 🎯 Step 7: Causal Inference

### What is Causal Inference?

**Causal Inference** = Understanding what *causes* outcomes, not just what's *correlated*.

**Example:** 
- **Correlation**: Higher latency is associated with lower acceptance
- **Causation**: Does latency *cause* lower acceptance, or are both caused by something else (like suggestion quality)?

### 7.1 Run Causal Analysis

```bash
python app.py causal
```

**What happens:**
1. Uses advanced statistical methods (propensity score matching, regression adjustment)
2. Controls for confounding variables
3. Estimates the true causal effect

**Expected output:**
```
======================================================================
CAUSAL INFERENCE ANALYSIS
======================================================================

📊 PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATE:              +0.130
95% CI:           [+0.101, +0.159]
Matched pairs:    5234
Interpretation:   Treatment increases accepted by 13.0%

📈 REGRESSION ADJUSTMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATE:              +0.128
95% CI:           [+0.099, +0.157]
...
```

**What this tells us:**
- After controlling for other factors, v2 still increases acceptance by ~13%
- This is the *true causal effect*, not just correlation
- Multiple methods give similar results (robustness check)

**Key Insight:** This is how Data Scientists prove that a feature actually *causes* improvements, not just correlates with them.

## 💻 Step 8: Code Evaluation Pipeline

### What is Code Evaluation?

**Code Evaluation** = Testing if AI-generated code actually works correctly.

### 8.1 Generate Code from AI

```bash
python app.py generate
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads coding tasks from `tasks/tasks.json`
2. For each task, generates code (using a simple placeholder model)
3. Saves generated code to `code_solutions/` folder

**Expected output:**
```
Generating code for task: fizzbuzz
✅ Wrote code for task fizzbuzz to code_solutions/fizzbuzz.py
Generating code for task: is_palindrome
✅ Wrote code for task is_palindrome to code_solutions/is_palindrome.py
...
```

**What tasks are evaluated:**
- `fizzbuzz`: Print numbers with Fizz/Buzz rules
- `is_palindrome`: Check if string is palindrome
- `binary_search`: Search in sorted array
- `reverse_linked_list`: Reverse a linked list
- `validate_email`: Validate email format

### 8.2 Test the Generated Code

```bash
python app.py evaluate
```

**What happens:**
1. Imports each generated code file
2. Runs test cases to check correctness
3. Calculates edit distance (how different from reference solution)
4. Classifies failure modes (syntax error, runtime error, logical error)

**Expected output:**
```
🔍 Evaluating task: fizzbuzz
  Result: passed, edit_distance=5
🔍 Evaluating task: is_palindrome
  Result: passed, edit_distance=8
...

📄 Wrote evaluation results to code_eval_results.json
```

**Understanding the Results:**
- **Status**: `passed` = code works correctly, `failed_tests` = code has bugs
- **Edit Distance**: How many character changes needed to match reference. Lower = better.
- **Failure Modes**: Why code failed (syntax, runtime, logic)

**Key Insight:** This is how Data Scientists measure code quality, not just acceptance rate!

---

## 📊 Step 9: Interactive Dashboard

### What is the Dashboard?

The **Dashboard** = A visual interface to explore all the data and results.

### 9.1 Launch the Dashboard

```bash
python app.py dashboard
```

**What happens:**
1. Starts a Streamlit web server
2. Opens your browser automatically
3. Shows interactive visualizations

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Running: streamlit run dashboard/app.py

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501
